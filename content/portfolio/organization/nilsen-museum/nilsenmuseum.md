The Nilsen Museum is all the work I'm doing now. It's a one person design and consulting firm specializing in creativity, play, and learning.  
I work with adults on things like program and product design, and I work with kids on things like co-designing new ways to ignite interest-driven learning.  

My whole career (or more accurately, my whole life) has revolved around building and supporting communities of interest-driven learning. From my childhood as an unschooled self-directed learner, to [starting an agile learning center](https://liam.media/portfolio/endor-alc/), to teaching the principles of [creative learning at the LEGO Foundation](https://liam.media/portfolio/the-lego-idea-studio/), my driving force has been to create a more just and equitable world through communities of people teaching and learning from one another.

## Consulting

The 21st century is collaborative. Don’t preach at; play _with_.  
I support the development of products, services, and events by putting a focus on user meaning-making through play and creativity.  
  
What that means is empowering event attendees to co-create their experience; making tools for users to utilize in new and unexpected ways; for colleagues to have the tools they need to build a culture of reflection and learning.

## Workshops

### Adults 
Workshops weave through play, reflective discussion, and a little lecturing to give attendees an embodied experience of constructionist learning and the power of designing for user-agency.

### Kids 
Workshops primarily focus on play and everything that happens therein. The activities and workshop goals facilitate toward a balance of frustration and accomplishment.
