I ran a program at the LEGO Foundation called Learning Learning Through Play Through Learning Through Play. The program was designed to give my colleagues an embodied sense of what _learning through play_ feels like through experiences of play and interest-driven exploration, so that their work in program design, grant management, and policy advising cold be informed by those experiences of play.

The initiative started in the form of monthly [Open Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) sessions where colleagues were invited to host sessions on any topic they found interesting and relevant. In a workplace of highly professional and career focused people, spending work-time playing with shadows and circuitry could be difficult. I pushed this feeling, bringing colleagues mushroom hunting in the woods after one of them voiced an interest in mycology.
