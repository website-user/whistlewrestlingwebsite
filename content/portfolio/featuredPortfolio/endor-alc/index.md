Endor ALC was a community and resource center for self-directed learners aged 14-18 in Asheville, North Carolina.  
It was open from fall 2013 to spring 2017. A member of the [Agile Learning Centers network](https://agilelearningcenters.org/), Endor used (and remixed) tools and practices from agile management to enable students to reach their goals and co-create the culture of the organization.

## Philosophy

Endor's "curriculum", for lack of a better term, was based in supporting self-directed learning. We put a higher value on building the skills involved in pursuing interests than on learning specific content. This was facilitated using (and remixing) a range of tools developed by the Agile Learning Centers network.

Each week would start with students setting intentions for for what they wanted to focus on that week, recording those intentions in a [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) board, and declaring them to the rest of the class. Each week would end with students sharing reflections on what they had done that week. Had they accomplished what they wanted? What would they do differently next week? etc.

## History

Without any initial funding, Endor started in a _minimal viable product_ form in 2013, meeting in [Mojo Coworking](https://www.mojocoworking.com/en) and venturing out to public meeting places for workshops and discussions.

In the fall of 2014, Endor began renting space in a downtown dance studio and operated 09:00 - 15:00 Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.

In 2015, Endor moved across town to be a part of [Open Space AVL](http://www.openspaceavl.org/), a community/project space shared with the [Asheville Maker Space](http://ashevillemakers.org/) and [AVL Tool Library](https://ashevilletoollibrary.org/).  At its height, Endor had a total of 22 students and four facilitators.

I used to blog about our goings on at least once a week. You can find that old blog [here](https://endor.agilelearningcenters.org/blog/) and the old homepage [here](https://endor.agilelearningcenters.org/).

## Crowdfunding Campaign

In 2015 Endor ran an Indiegogo campaign, raising $3,000 for facilitator training, computers, and other tools.  
You can see the campaign page [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/endor-alc#/) and watch the cutely pathetic campaign video below.
