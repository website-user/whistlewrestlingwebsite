My dear friend Liam is getting married this year.

For all three of Liam's mother's kids weddings, `____` has made a quilt for her kids and their new spouses, given at their respective weddings.

What's so special about these quilts is that all the quilt squares are made by the couple's friends.

I just finished the quilt square I am contributing, here it is sitting on the counter at the post office, preparing for its journey across the Atlantic.

It was inspired by a hexagon quilt my grandmother made, the game _the Settlers of Catan_Â - and the Pennsylvania countryside.

I finished this project with a renewed interest in quilting.

stay tuned for a picture
