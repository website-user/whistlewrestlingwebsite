The coolest place in Billund to have your photo taken is in the Duplo pool at LEGO House.

When LEGO Papert Fellow Stefania Druga from the MIT Media Lab came to the Studio for a weeklong residency, we went for a visit at LEGO House and took full advantage of the photo ops.

And then the Media Lab used one of the photos in their [weekly newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/media/mlweekly-1222?e=9fdfa9baec).

Building up for future photography career.

Stay tuned for more on the LEGO Papert Fellowships.
