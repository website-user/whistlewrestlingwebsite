### Work I've done with sounds (unfinished)

In 2016 I worked as a volunteer journalist at _"Asheville FM, WSFM-LP at 103.3 FM._"  
I grew up listening to WNYC more or less constantly, so going from being a listener to being a producer of news on the radio was an incredibly empowering experience. I don't think I was very good at. I didn't have the time to put much work into each story, but that constraint of a weekly deadline was empowering; you made your segment as good as possible and then got ready to go into Studio A at 6:58PM each Thursday.

I produced a few more stories than these two, but these are the only mp3s I've still got.
