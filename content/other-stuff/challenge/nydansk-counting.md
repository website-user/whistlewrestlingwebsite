### About the challenge
A short time after I co-invented the "New-Danish" counting system, fellow AMOK member Kasper issued me this challenge. The New Danish Counting System continues the 20-based "snes" system that classical Danish uses for numbers from 50-90, applying that logic to all numbers from 10-189, the highest number we've figured out how to count to using this system.

Kasper says I messed up one of the numbers in the video, but I can't find it, and he hasn't made his own, and now the proposed deadline of 2023-12-31 has passed, so, I'm taking this as a win.

| **More detail, if necessary:**      | I, Don Kasperaliteten, hereby challenge chairman [Liam Nilsen] to do the world's first video recording of the "nydansk" number system.  <br>  <br>This system extrapolates the principle of how the Danish numbers from 50, "halvtreds", to 90, "halvfems", are pronounced to extent to ALL numbers. As a logical consequence of this principle, the highest possible number is, "ni-og-halv-nis", 189 (whereas all succeeding numbers must be factorized of these).  <br>  <br>The video recording of the counting session must satisfy the following criteria:  <br>  <br>- The ONLY person appearing in the video must be Don/Liam, respectively, in a facial close-up  <br>- The person MUST count from 0 to 189 pronouncing the numbers in accordance with the rules of nydansk  <br>- The recording CANNOT accept any errors in pronunciation, although hesitation and breaks are accepted  <br>- It is FORBIDDEN to edit, mix or in any way post-produce the recording - the only final product allowed is a one-take recording  <br>- NO external aids can be used to remember the number system - the whole sequence must be recited from heart or from memory  <br>  <br>The first person to successfully record, upload and send their recording to the other, will be registered as the world's first nydanske counting recording. |
