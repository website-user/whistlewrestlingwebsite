# Create a full-length cover of a Joe Rogan episode

### Status: ❌ Failed

### About the challenge
In fall of 2020, I had an idea for a podcast. Covers, a podcast where each episode is a word-for-word "cover" of an episode of another podcast. I shared this idea with a few friends, including Blake, during COVID-19 era zoom party. 

I thought that it could be a genuinely funny/interesting podcast for the growing audience of heavy podcast listeners, to hear someone else's take on a classic episode of This American Life, Serial, RadioLab, or Reply All. Especially if it was, say, a _country_ cover, or _metal_ cover, of those shows. 

I also thought that reproducing the greats would be a good way of learning how the likes of Jad Abumrad and Phia Bennin.

Blake challenged me to cover an episode of _The Joe Rogan Experience_. It's not a show I usually lsiten to, but I knew that most episodes were upward of 3hrs long. I found the shortest episode I could find (about 25 minutes), and got lost in transcription. There were two or three guests, and they all had very similar voices. It was a really early episode, so it wasn't filmed or anything. 

I failed.
Or, I didn't meet the deadline. 
And I still haven't made a single episode of covers. 
But I haven't abondoned the project.
